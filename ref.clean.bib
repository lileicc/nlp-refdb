  abstract   = {In transparent alphabetic languages, the expected standard for complete acquisition of letter-speech sound associations is within one year of reading instruction. The neural mechanisms underlying the acquisition of letter-speech sound associations have, however, hardly been investigated. The present article describes an ERP study with beginner and advanced readers in which the influence of letters on speech sound processing is investigated by comparing the MMN to speech sounds presented in isolation with the MMN to speech sounds accompanied by letters. Furthermore, SOA between letter and speech sound presentation was manipulated in order to investigate the development of the temporal window of integration for letter-speech sound processing. Beginner readers, despite one year of reading instruction, showed no early letter-speech sound integration, that is, no influence of the letter on the evocation of the MMN to the speech sound. Only later in the difference wave, at 650 msec, was an influence of the letter on speech sound processing revealed. Advanced readers, with 4 years of reading instruction, showed early and automatic letter-speech sound processing as revealed by an enhancement of the MMN amplitude, however, at a different temporal window of integration in comparison with experienced adult readers. The present results indicate a transition from mere association in beginner readers to more automatic, but still not "adult-like," integration in advanced readers. In contrast to general assumptions, the present study provides evidence for an extended development of letter-speech sound integration.},

  abstract = {Most people acquire literacy skills with remarkable ease, even though the human brain is not evolutionarily adapted to this relatively new cultural phenomenon. Associations between letters and speech sounds form the basis of reading in alphabetic scripts. We investigated the functional neuroanatomy of the integration of letters and speech sounds using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Letters and speech sounds were presented unimodally and bimodally in congruent or incongruent combinations. Analysis of single-subject data and group data aligned on the basis of individual cortical anatomy revealed that letters and speech sounds are integrated in heteromodal superior temporal cortex. Interestingly, responses to speech sounds in a modality-specific region of the early auditory cortex were modified by simultaneously presented letters. These results suggest that efficient processing of culturally defined associations between letters and speech sounds relies on neural mechanisms similar to those naturally evolved for integrating audiovisual speech.},

However, the sentence embeddings from the pre-trained language models without fine-tuning have been found to poorly capture semantic meaning of sentences. In this paper, we argue that the semantic information in the BERT embeddings is not fully exploited. We first reveal the theoretical connection between the masked language model pre-training objective and the semantic similarity task theoretically, and then analyze the BERT sentence embeddings empirically. We find that BERT always induces a non-smooth anisotropic semantic space of sentences, which harms its performance of semantic similarity. To address this issue, we propose to transform the anisotropic sentence embedding distribution to a smooth and isotropic Gaussian distribution through normalizing flows that are learned with an unsupervised objective. Experimental results show that our proposed BERT-flow method obtains significant performance gains over the state-of-the-art sentence embeddings on a variety of semantic textual similarity tasks.},

The crux is that the number of training samples for Maximum Likelihood Estimation is usually limited and the input data distributions are different at training and inference stages.  Many method shave been proposed to solve the above problem (Yu et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2018), which relies  on  sampling  from  the  non-stationary model distribution and suffers from high variance  or  biased  estimations.

  abstract  = {Deep generative models are commonly used for generating images and text. Interpretability of these models is one important pursuit, other than the generation quality. Variational auto-encoder (VAE) with Gaussian distribution as prior has been successfully applied in text generation, but it is hard to interpret the meaning of the latent variable. To enhance the controllability and interpretability, one can replace the Gaussian prior with a mixture of Gaussian distributions (GM-VAE), whose mixture components could be related to hidden semantic aspects of data. In this paper, we generalize the practice and introduce DEM-VAE, a class of models for text generation using VAEs with a mixture distribution of exponential family. Unfortunately, a standard variational training algorithm fails due to the mode-collapse problem. We theoretically identify the root cause of the problem and propose an effective algorithm to train DEM-VAE. Our method penalizes the training with an extra dispersion term to induce a well-structured latent space. Experimental results show that our approach does obtain a meaningful space, and it outperforms strong baselines in text generation benchmarks.

We propose the variational template machine (VTM), a novel method to generate text descriptions from data tables. Our contributions include:  a) we carefully devise a specific model architecture and losses to explicitly disentangle text template and semantic content information, in the latent spaces, and b) we utilize both small parallel data and large raw text without aligned tables to enrich the template learning. Experiments on datasets from a variety of different domains show that VTM is able generate more diversely while keeping a good fluency and quality.},

  abstract  = {Training neural machine translation models (NMT) requires a large amount of parallel corpus, which is scarce for many language pairs. However, raw non-parallel corpora are often easy to obtain. Existing approaches have not exploited the full potential of non-parallel bilingual data either in training or decoding. In this paper, we propose the mirror-generative NMT (MGNMT), a single unified architecture that simultaneously integrates the source to target translation model, the target to source translation model, and two language models. Both translation models and language models share the same latent semantic space, therefore both translation directions can learn from non-parallel data more effectively. Besides, the translation models and language models can collaborate together during decoding. Our experiments show that the proposed MGNMT consistently outperforms existing approaches in all a variety of scenarios and language pairs, including resource-rich and low-resource languages.},

  abstract  = {Many social media news writers are not professionally trained. Therefore, social media platforms have to hire professional editors to adjust amateur headlines to attract more readers. We propose to automate this headline editing process through neural network models to provide more immediate writing support for these social media news writers. To train such a neural headline editing model, we collected a dataset which contains articles with original headlines and professionally edited headlines. However, it is expensive to collect a large number of professionally edited headlines. To solve this low-resource problem, we design an encoder-decoder model which leverages large scale pre-trained language models. We further improve the pre-trained model's quality by introducing a headline generation task as an intermediate task before the headline editing task. Also, we propose Self Importance-Aware (SIA) loss to address the different levels of editing in the dataset by down-weighting the importance of easily classified tokens and sentences. With the help of Pre-training, Adaptation, and SIA, the model learns to generate headlines in the professional editor's style. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the quality of headline editing comparing against previous methods.},

KerBS embodies two advantages: a) it employs a Bayesian composition of embeddings for words with multiple senses; b) it is adaptive to semantic variances of words and
robust to rare sentence context by imposing learned kernels to capture the closeness of words (senses) in the embedding space. Empirical studies show that KerBS significantly boosts the performance of several text generation tasks.},

CAPSNMT uses an aggregation mechanism to map the source sentence into a matrix with pre-determined size, and then applys a deep LSTM network to decode the target sequence from the source representation. Unlike the previous work (Sutskever et al., 2014) to store the source sentence with a passive and bottom-up way, the dynamic routing policy encodes the source sentence with an iterative process to decide the credit attribution between nodes from lower and higher layers. CAPSNMT has two core properties: it runs in time that is linear in the length of the sequences and provides a more flexible way to aggregate the part-whole information of the source sentence. On WMT14 English-German task and a larger WMT14 English-French task, CAPSNMT achieves comparable results with the Transformer system. We also devise new hybrid architectures intended to combine the strength of CAPSNMT and the RNMT model. Our hybrid models obtain state-of-the-arts results on both benchmark datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that capsule networks have been empirically investigated for sequence to sequence problems},

To solve bothissues, we propose CAMIT, a novel method for translating in an interactive environment. Our proposed method works with critical revision instructions,therefore allows human to correct arbitrary words in model-translated sentences. In addition,CAMIT learns from and softly memorizes revision actions based on the context, alleviating the issue of repeating mistakes. Experiments in both ideal and real interactive translation settings demonstrate that our proposed CAMIT enhances machine translation results significantly while requires fewer revision instructions from human compared to previous methods.},

Our proposed method explicitly models syntactic information in the VAE’s latent space by using the linearized tree sequence, leading to better performance of language generation. Additionally, the advantage of sampling in the disentangled syntactic and semantic latent spaces enables us to perform novel applications, such as the unsupervised paraphrase generation and syntax-transfer generation.

Inspired by human’s step-by-step reasoning behavior, DFGN includes a dynamic fusion layer that starts from the entities mentioned in the given query, explores along the entity graph dynamically built from the text, and gradually finds relevant supporting entities from the given documents. We evaluate DFGN on HotpotQA, a public TBQA dataset requiring multi-hop reasoning. DFGN achieves competitive results on the public board.

semantic components such as object or relational descriptors,
and align their embeddings with different regions of a

effective learning of such fine-grained alignment from only
image-caption pairs. We also present a simple yet effective
approach that enforces the coverage of caption embeddings
on the semantic components that appear in the sentence. We
demonstrate that the Unified VSE outperforms other baselines
on cross-modal retrieval tasks and the enforcement
of the semantic coverage improves models’ robustness in
defending text-domain adversarial attacks. Moreover, such

  abstract  = {In real-world applications of natural language generation,
there are often constraints on the target sentences in addition
to fluency and naturalness requirements. Existing language
generation techniques are usually based on recurrent
neural networks (RNNs). However, it is non-trivial to impose
constraints on RNNs while maintaining generation quality,
since RNNs generate sentences sequentially (or with beam
search) from the first word to the last. In this paper, we propose
CGMH, a novel approach using Metropolis-Hastings
sampling for constrained sentence generation. CGMH allows
complicated constraints such as the occurrence of multiple
keywords in the target sentences, which cannot be handled in
traditional RNN-based approaches. Moreover, CGMH works
in the inference stage, and does not require parallel corpora
for training.We evaluate our method on a variety of tasks, including
keywords-to-sentence generation, unsupervised sentence
paraphrasing, and unsupervised sentence error correction.
CGMH achieves high performance compared with previous

To study the effectiveness of different tree structures, we replace the parsing trees with trivial trees (i.e., binary balanced tree, left-branching tree and right-branching tree) in the encoders. Though trivial trees contain no syntactic information, those encoders get competitive or even better results on all of the ten downstream tasks we investigated. This surprising result indicates that explicit syntax guidance may not be the main contributor to the superior performances of tree-based neural sentence modeling. Further analysis show that tree modeling gives better results when crucial words are closer to the final representation. Additional experiments give more clues on how to design an effective tree-based encoder.},
